# Introduction
The assignment for HW4 is to analyze and model a dataset containing
approximately 8000 records representing customers of an auto insurance company.
Each record has two response variables. The first response variable,
`TARGET_FLAG`, is a 1 or a 0. where a `1` means that the person was in a car
and a `0` means that the person was not in a car crash. The second response
variable is `TARGET_AMT`. This value is 0 if the person did not crash their car.
However, if they did crash their car, this number will be a value greater than
zero.

The objective of the assignment is to build multiple linear regression and
binary logistic regression models on the training data to predict **both** the
probability that a person will crash their car and the amount of money it will
cost given a crash. Only the variables in the dataset, or variables directly
derived from them, may be used.
