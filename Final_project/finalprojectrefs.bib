We here present two simple models for predicting the future popularity of Web content based on historical information given by early popularity measures. Our approach is validated on datasets consisting of videos from the widely used YouTube video-sharing portal. Our experimental results show that, compared to a state-of-the-art baseline model, our proposed models lead to significant decreases in relative squared errors, reaching up to 20% reduction on average, and larger reductions (of up to 71%) for videos that experience a high peak in popularity in their early days followed by a sharp decrease in popularity.},
